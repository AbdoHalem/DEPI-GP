This project is my graduation project at DEPI IBM Data Science Diploma.

## Project:Medical Representative
Medical representatives are the key point of contact between
pharmaceutical and medical companies and healthcare professionals.
A medical representative's job is to promote and sell their company's
products, whether that's pharmaceutical drugs or medical equipment.
Customers can include doctors, nurses and pharmacists. The medical
representative will increase product awareness, answer queries,
company.

The job of medical representative has a lot of challenges but the most
important one is how the medical representative convinces a doctor to write a
drug from the medical company which he works for in his prescription where
there are many competitors' drugs that have the same active ingredient from
other companies.
The goal is to know if a doctor with some
specific features will write or not one of 6 drugs for a medical
company that has license to produce several types of local produced
drugs with the same active ingredients of multinational original drugs.
